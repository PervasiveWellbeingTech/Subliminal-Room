# Subliminal Room: MONITOR

This repo contains code developed and collected for monitoring subject physiology.

The repo contains several important files:
```
BioHarness Log Downloader.exe --> download logs from BH3 device
Zephyr Config Tool.exe --> configure BH3 device
BioHarness Bluetooth Test Application V2.exe --> connects to BH3 over BT
```
Also, the library includes the zephyr library by Joonas Paalasmaa, David Murphy and Ove Holmqvist that enables real-time data collection over BT. The code needs to be tweaked to work in conjunction to the experiment.
