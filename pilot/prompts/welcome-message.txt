Welcome, you will be asked to complete two kinds of tasks: a working memory task (called MEMORY) and an arithmetic task (called ARITHMETIC). You will know which task you will perform by a screen that indicates which task you will be performing. Each task will take {} and {} minutes, respectively. After completing each task, a short questionaire will be presented to you. Upon completing one ARITHMETIC and one MEMORY task, you will be allowed a {}-second break. Press "{}" to continue on to the instructions of the specific tasks.
