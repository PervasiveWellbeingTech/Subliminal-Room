# Subliminal Room Repository

This repo contains code developed and collected for the Subliminal Room project.

## Getting Started

The repo is organized by categorical structure. Each sense has following:
```
sense/lib --> contains code library for 'sense'
sense/libs.py --> allows importing of other senses' libraries
sense/README.md --> specific directions for 'sense'
sense/*.py -->  client code that uses libraries
```
Additionally,
```
.reference/ --> contains master directories of 3rd party libraries
.common-lib/ --> contains a multithreading implementation
pilot/ --> contains Psychopy experiment
```
### Prerequisites

You will need the listed requirements in
```
.reference/requirements.txt
```
and additionally follow the [protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7-t7KGIc4zJZ2MrPT0B6_Eaof6T_vQGiSE-uxVb7GY/edit?usp=sharing) to be able to run the experiment.
