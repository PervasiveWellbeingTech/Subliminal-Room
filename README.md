## Getting Started

The repo is organized by categorical structure. Each sense has following:
```

sense/libs.py --> allows importing of other senses' libraries
sense/README.md --> specific directions for 'sense'
sense/*.py -->  client code that uses libraries
```
Additionally,
```
.reference/ --> contains master directories of 3rd party libraries
.common-lib/ --> contains a multithreading implementation
pilot/ --> contains Psychopy experiment
```
### Prerequisites

You will need the listed requirements in
```
